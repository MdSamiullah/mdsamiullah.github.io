## Welcome
I’m **Md Samiullah**. I am a researcher and educator with a strong focus on intelligent systems, data science, and applied machine learning. My work bridges theory and practice — from developing robust models for real-world problems such as cybersecurity, malware detection, and mental health analytics, to translating research insights into scalable, impactful solutions.

Alongside my research, I am deeply committed to teaching and mentorship, guiding students through data-driven thinking, algorithmic design, and practical implementation. I enjoy building systems that are not only technically sound but also socially meaningful, collaborating across disciplines to solve complex challenges at the intersection of AI, data, and human behavior.
